# Working with dates in Python

- Successfully wrote four functions to do simple processing on dates using Python's datetime module as a final project for the 'Python Programming Essentials' course

- The problems addressed by this project include:
    + Computing the number of days in a month
    + Checking if a date is valid
    + Computing the number of dates between two dates
    + And finally calculating a person's age in days
